ðŸš€ UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS - Fix Vite Manifest Error

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
Your Laravel app is missing the built assets. Here's how to fix it:

STEP 1: Build Assets Locally (if not already done)
- Run: npm run build
- This creates the public/build/ directory with all needed files

STEP 2: Upload to Server
Upload the ENTIRE "public/build/" directory to your server at:
/home/u546312304/domains/green-wolverine-495039.hostingersite.com/public_html/public/build/

STEP 3: Verify Upload
After uploading, check that these files exist on your server:
âœ… public_html/public/build/manifest.json
âœ… public_html/public/build/assets/ (directory with JS/CSS files)

STEP 4: Clear Laravel Caches
Run these commands on your server:
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear

STEP 5: Test
Visit your website - the error should be gone!

ALTERNATIVE: If you can't upload files
1. Upload server-diagnostic.php to your server
2. Run: php server-diagnostic.php
3. Share the output for help

QUICK CHECK:
- The error shows Laravel is looking for: /public_html/public/build/manifest.json
- Make sure you upload to the EXACT path: public_html/public/build/
- Not just: public_html/build/

Need help? Upload the server-diagnostic.php file and run it on your server!
